New in version 0.3.5
====================

- Test script file name and sheet name are now printed in the console in cyan instead of in red.
- Printing the entire script on start is conditional on *testx.logScript* parameter; defaults to false.
- Setting now waits for the element to be clickable instead of just visible.
- Fix for getting from a *select* element - now returns just the selected options text.
- Added release notes file (this document).
